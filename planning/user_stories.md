As a parent or caregiver, I want to create personalized bedtime stories for my child by providing their name, age, gender, parents' names, friends' names, siblings, favorite toys, fictional characters, location, and specific themes. I also want the option to select educational topics such as friendship, dental hygiene, potty training, or other relevant themes.
I aslo able to chose length of the storie (bar graph)

- The app should have a user-friendly interface where I can easily input my child's details and preferences.
- I should be able to choose educational topics from a list or input custom themes.
- i should be able to save stories that I like and have an acces for them at any time
- Each story should be appropriate for my child's age and interests.
- in saved stories there is an option (button) to continue current stories (like part 2)
