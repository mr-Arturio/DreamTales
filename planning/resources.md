For our app, we are planning to use React and the Next.js framework, which is new to us. Before we start working with this framework, it's better to go through the official Next.js tutorial available at https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app. Additionally, there is a good video tutorial series at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g9gP2onazU5-2M-AzA8eBw, and another useful video about Next.js can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sklc_fQBmcs&list=PLIE0yVlwvZ99TLY6IgVnjKKUP93ygnRg9&index=2.

Question: Is Next.js too complex for our app?

I really like how Next.js makes it easy to create serverless API endpoints directly within the application using its built-in API routes. This simplifies handling backend logic and data fetching, allowing us to build our API without setting up a separate server. Moreover, Next.js is a popular technology and is in demand among hiring companies. Therefore, we have decided that it's beneficial to become familiar with it.

We are also planning to utilize OpenAI technologies, but this requires some learning as well. To get started, it's a good idea to go through the documentation available at https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction. There is also a comprehensive ChatGPT Course at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRQH2CFvedY&list=PLIE0yVlwvZ99TLY6IgVnjKKUP93ygnRg9&index=2&t=279s, which, although lengthy, but it will be worth spending a couple of days on to gain familiarity with the technologies. AI is not a new technology, but it has recently become available to the public, and we are excited to try and explore this cool tool.

Regarding the database, do we need to know Prisma to work with PostgreSQL?
